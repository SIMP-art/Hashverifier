## HashVerifier

File hash verifier using built-in hashing module in [Go](https://go.dev/)

- Show hash sum of file
- 3 sum hash available (sha1, sha256, md5)
- Compare hash between 2 files

## Installation

Hashverifier requires [Go](https://go.dev/) v1.18.*+ to run.

Building

```sh
go build main.go
```
After finished build we will put the exuteable file into one of our system env path, as an example output file was `main.exe` and I'll rename it to `hashcheck.exe` after that I'll move the `hashcheck.exe` to "C:\Windows\System32", See how to use after moved file to system32 below
## Usage
open cmd and type as down below and program will tell you how to use
```
hashcheck
```
or using compare mode by
```
hashcheck compare
```
> Q: Why I made this?
A: cuz I want to check hash sum of file but I'm too lazy to open linux and use sha256sum
